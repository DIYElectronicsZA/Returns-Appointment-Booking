Returns-Appointment-Booking

An Internal automated bookings system that captures users data and posts to a slack channel via a python scrpit.  

User info is entered into a static HTML page which posts values submitted to a python script.  
The python script then in turn uses a service key provided through Slack Webhooks to post the formatted information into a channel.
